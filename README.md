# Show Muted
A simple program that changes from one solid color to another when you press your 'mute microphone' keybinds.  
  
The main use case is to have a window on your second monitor that turns red (or any color) when you mute your microphone in Discord, so you can always tell if your mic is muted in your peripheral vision.

**Important:** Windows may give a false warning which can be safely ignored by pressing "More info" then "Run anyway".
