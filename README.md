### About
Show Muted is a program that changes from one solid color to another when you press your 'mute microphone' keybinds.  
  
The main use case is to have a window on your second monitor that turns red (or any color) when you mute your microphone in Discord, so you can always tell if your mic is muted in your peripheral vision.  

### Features
You can...
- bind Toggle-Mute and Push-to-Mute with the same binds you can have in Discord.
- change the colors it swaps between in settings with RGB and HSV sliders.
- save window locations on the screen to quickly swap between them.
- press the 'Manual Toggle' button to manually swap the colors to synchronize it with Discord.
