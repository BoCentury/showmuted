INSTRUCTIONS:
Go into Settings and set up the same Toggle-Mute and Push-to-Mute binds you have in Discord.
You can save window locations in Settings->Layouts to quickly swap locations for different uses.

INFO:
Settings and window positions get saved to 'settings.ini' in the same folder as 'showmuted.exe'.
You don't _have_ to use it along side Discord.
It's just a window that changes color when you press a key/mouse combination.
This program uses zero hooks. It just uses raw input messages so you don't need to worry about performance.
